# 3-column-preview-card-component-main
 Frontend Mentor - Challenger.

## Method used for complete the challenge
Basically I used the flexbox property to position the elements on the page, and after that I started to style the elements to make them as similar as possible to the example image.

### Points i need improve
I need to better understand the issue of positioning elements on the page, in addition to improving the construction of my code and using more semantic tags instead of using several <divs> on the page.
